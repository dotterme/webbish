Webbish
=======

Webbish is a lightwight & modern Web front-end foundation based on HTML5, Require.js, and Java. Webbish gets the tedious stuff out of your way and lets you focus on great front-end code without getting mired in the legacy of heavyweight server-side scripting frameworks.

## Features at a glance

* Super-minimal and a piece of cake to use
* Designed for pure Ajax. No server-side templating.
* Build fully themeable pages, with built-in support for Twitter Bootstrap and Normalize.js, or any other CSS framework
* Based on [AMD](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html) and [Require.js](http://requirejs.org), making it sinfully easy to use any framework you want
* Mix reusable headers and footers across pages
* Supports both single- and multi-page apps
* Intended to be used with a JAX-RS front controller for friendly site URLs. See [Webbish Boilerplate](https://github.com/toddfast/webbish-boilerplate) for more info.
* Deploy and scale applications as WAR files on any Java EE servlet container, like [Glassfish](http://glassfish.java.net/), JBoss, or Tomcat. (Note, Webbish uses Java EE servlets and JSPs for plumbing, not in normal application development.)
* Fully [Mavenized](http://maven.apache.org/) so you can easily open, edit, build, and deploy the project in your favorite IDE like [NetBeans](http://netbeans.org) or Eclipse. Maven support also makes for easy continuous integration and automatic deployment via [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/), and makes writing and running unit tests with [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) easy.

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started with Webbish is to fork the [Webbish Boilerplate](https://github.com/toddfast/webbish-boilerplate) repository and start modifying it. Because Webbish Boilerplate is Mavenized, you can easily open, edit, build, and deploy the project in your favorite IDE like [NetBeans](http://netbeans.org) or Eclipse.
